trinkchocolate declares itself as a non-blog theme. This does not mean that there is no capability to publish posts into a blog-like archive, it is just not the focus.

The included archive is meant for two things: Representating current / finished projects and spreading news. But the "blog" will never be the center of the page. Use other templates for that.
