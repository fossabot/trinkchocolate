### Whats in this theme?
Not much. Just enough to get the job done.

### Um .. and in detail?
* Some HTML Templates
* A little bit of flexbox-CSS
* Some snippets of JS

.. providing the following awesome features:  

* **Templates**: The page content is created in markdown, a general content description language. Hugo generates the final website out of the template and the content, at your service.
* **Configurable**: Using a single `.toml`-configuration file, the whole look and feel of the theme can be customized
* Disposable: As the content is not connected with the actual theme, it is always possible to switch to other themes. trinkchocolate would be very sad tough.
