# Trinkchocolate

**Trinkchocolate** is a bare-minimum, non-blog [hugo](http://gohugo.io)-theme aimed for sporadically changing static sites.

### Why?
This theme aims to address a typical small-business problem: We need a website! Hooray! But .. how? While a lot of smaller companies seem to create an all-static html/cs
s only site once and never touch it again (who wants to touch html as a non-programmer? Obvious. Nobody), that's definitely not the way to go.

trinkchocolate to the rescue. Using the awesome templating of hugo, it creates a way to get a nice looking website, without touching a single line of code.

While markdown might be like code, it is way more simple for the usual user to learn and understand than html, so it might be possible that the page gets updated from ti
me to time. Hooray! Job done.

### How?
trinkchocolate is based off the awesome [cocoa-eh](https://github.com/mtn/cocoa-eh-hugo-theme) theme, stripping away all the fancy features (sorry) and refactoring the configuration to provide an easy to use, dist
raction free website creating experience.
