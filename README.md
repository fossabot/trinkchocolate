# Trinkchocolate

**Trinkchocolate** is a [hugo](http://gohugo.io) theme for simple, static and sporadically changing websites,
for example small-business homepages.

It is based on the [cocoa-eh](https://github.com/mtn/cocoa-eh-hugo-theme) theme, but is being stripped down to a bare minimum in terms of functionality and lines of code.
